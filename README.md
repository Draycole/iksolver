# Two-Link Inverse Kinematics Solver  
### A Geometric Engine for Solving the Inverse Kinematics of a Planar Two-Link Robot Arm<br>

A visual and interactive 2-DOF planar robot arm built with **Streamlit** and **Python**, featuring both:

-  **A deployed interactive web app**  
-  **A standalone local Python IK solver (CLI + Matplotlib)**

This repository contains all the code needed to study the mathematics, visualization, and implementation of inverse kinematics for a simple 2-link robotic arm.
